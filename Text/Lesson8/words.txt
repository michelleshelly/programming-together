Once upon a time, there was a little boy named John. His hair long and pants were short and he couldn't concentrate very long.
John has a sister named Phoebe. She had long hair and small eyes and round cheeks. And she liked playing with barbie dolls.
So it was, that John and Phoebe were siblings one and all. Whose parents loved playing chess.
They lived happily ever after. The end.
